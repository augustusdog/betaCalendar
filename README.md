# (Be-Ta)Calendar
## What is it?
betaCalendar is a functional, albeit much more basic, alternative to flatPicker.

## What's it's Unique Selling Point? i.e... why should I care?
betaCalendar makes it possible to easily integrate with the google calendar API for dates AND times. Additionally, I find it much easier to know what time slots are availalble to be booked.

## How to install
npm install betacalendar OR
npm install augustusdog/betaCalendar#main

## Going forward
If you decide to add any functionality / to make any improvements, please do. I will happily review any improvements and push them to the main branch/npm.
